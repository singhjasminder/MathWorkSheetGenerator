# MathWorkSheetGenerator
Python code to generate simple Math problems (Addition, Multiplication) between two numbers

This code was written to learn Python language while producing something practical that I can use for my kids. 

Program asks user input for: 
  their name
  choice between Addition or Multiplication operations
  number of questions
  range of numbers from which operands will be randomly generated
  
 After taking in all this information, program creates at .txt file with questions and saves into local directory.

Next step is dockerize this application
